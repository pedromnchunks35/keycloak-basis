# Info
- Keycloak is a tool for creating security out of the box
- We can integrate it with LDAP and Active Directory Servers
- We can delegate the authentication to third party providers like Facebook and Google
# Basic Keycloak operations
- Keycloak is a separate server that we manage in our network
- Apps are confired to point to this server for authentication
# Core concepts and terms
- Users
  - Entities that are able to log into the system
  - They can have a lot of attributes such as email,username,address,phone number and birthday
  - We can assign to them group memberships and have specific roles assigned to them
- Authentication
  - Process of identifying and validating a user
- Authorization
  - The process of granting access to a user
- Credentials
  - Pieces of data that keycloak uses to verify the identity of a user (passwords,digital certificates or fingerprints)
- Roles 
  - Type of user
- User role mapping
  - We mape a mapping between a user and a role so that we can use its role into tokens so that apps can decide access permissions on various resources they manage
- Composite roles
  - Roles that are associated with another roles
  - If a user gains the role of a role that is upper in the hierarchical association of roles then he ihnerits the permissions of those roles 
- Groups
  - We also have groups that are composites of users that we can associate attributes
  - We can also associate this groups to roles the same way we can associate users
- Realms
  - A real manages a set of users,credentials,roles and groups
  - A user belongs to and logs into a realm
  - Realms are isolated from each other
- Clients
  - Entities that can request keycloak to authenticate a user
  - Most often apps and services
  - Also this clients are the ones that request tokens to access other apps services
- Client adapters
  - Plugins that we install in our app to communicate with keycloak
- Consent
  - A user granting access of its information by the client
- Client scopes
  - Client scopes are default mapping and roles for a given user to make it easier to register new users
- Client role
  - Clients can define roles that are specific to them
- Identity token
  - A token that provides info about the user
- Acess token
  - A token that grants access to something
- Assertion
  - Info about a user
- Service account
  - A account that each client has to obtain an access token
- Direct grant
  - Way of a client obtain a access token on behalf of a user via REST invocation
- Protocol mappers
  - For each client we can tailor what claims and assertions are stores in the OIDC token or SAML assertion
  - You do this per client
- Session
  - When a user logins a session gets created
  - Both users and admins can view session information
- User Federation Provider
  - We can use LDAP or Active directory that store user and credential information
- Identity Provider
  - Keycloak is a IDP (identity provider)
- Identity Provider Federation
  - Keycloak can be configured to delegate the authentication to one or more IDPs
- Identity provider mappers
  - You can map incoming tokens and assertions to user and session attributes
- Required Actions
  - Something that a user is obligated to do during the authentication process
- Authentication Flows
  - What a user must do to get authenticated
- Events
  - We can view logs as a admin
- Themes
  - Keycloak has teams that we can override
